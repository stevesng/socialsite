I. OVERVIEW

   You can install SocialSite EA1 software in either of two ways, both of which 
   are described in this document:
   
   - Using the precompiled binary (JAR-based) installer package
   - Checking out the workspace and compiling the project source code
   
   Installing the precompiled binary is the recommended and easiest of the two 
   methods. The installer is platform-independent, and can be used on any system 
   that supports Java, including Sun Solaris, Microsoft Windows, UNIX systems, 
   Linux, and MacOS, among others.
   ________________________________
   I.A. WHICH PACKAGE SHOULD I USE?
   
   Most users should use the precompiled JAR-based binary installer. The 
   instructions for using this installer are provided in Section II of this 
   document. If you use the installer, you can skip the remainder of this 
   document after Section II.
   
   If you prefer to check out and compile the source code yourself, skip Section 
   II, and instead follow the instructions beginning in Section III.
   ______________________
   I.B. BEFORE PROCEEDING
      
   Before proceeding with either installation method, GlassFish v2, JDK 5 or JDK 
   6, and Apache Ant 1.65 or greater must be installed on the machine on which 
   SocialSite EA1 software will be installed. If you are checking out and 
   building the source code yourself, you will also need a Subversion client to 
   interact with the workspace. These packages are available from the following 
   locations:
   
   - GlassFish Project:     https://glassfish.dev.java.net/
   - Sun JDK Download Page: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
   - Apache Ant Project:    http://ant.apache.org/
   - Subversion Project:    http://subversion.tigris.org/

II. STEPS TO INSTALL USING THE PRECOMPILED JAR-BASED INSTALLER

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   --- Only perform the steps in this section if you want to install ---
   --- SocialSite software using the precompiled binary JAR-based    ---
   --- installer. If you prefer to install SocialSite by checking    ---
   --- out and compiling the source code yourself, skip this section ---
   --- and instead follow the steps starting in Section III. After   ---
   --- completing the installer-based procedure described in this    ---
   --- section, you can skip the remainder of this document.         ---
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Download the installer JAR file from the SocialSite project Web site and
      save it to the location of your choice.

      https://socialsite.dev.java.net/

   2. Start the installer by executing the JAR, making sure to set the maximum
      Java heap size to at least 256MB:

      java -Xmx256m -jar <XXX>.jar
      
      where <XXX> is the JAR package name.
      
      The installation starts and you are prompted to review the license terms.
      
   3. Accept the license terms.

   4. Change to the SocialSite directory:

      cd SocialSite

   5. Edit the glassfish.props file, and specify the following (required):

      a. GLASSFISH_HOME
      b. AS_SERVER_NAME
      c. MAIL_SERVER_NAME
      d. MAIL_USER

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   --- On some Linux systems, it may also be necessary to modify     ---
   --- the DOMAIN_PATH to point to the location of the domain data   ---
   --- directories for your GlassFish installation. For example, on  ---
   --- some Linux systems, the GlassFish binaries are installed in   ---
   --- /usr/share/glassfishv2, but the domain data directories are   ---
   --- installed in /var/lib/glassfishv2. In this case, DOMAIN_PATH  ---
   --- should point to /var/lib/glassfishv2.                         ---
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   6. (Optionally) edit the socialsite.props file and specify the
      following (if you do not want to use the default values) :

      a. SSADMIN_EMAIL
      b. SSADMIN_USER
      c. SSADMIN_PASSWORD

   7. If you have previously installed SocialSite on this server, you must
      run the following ant task before continuing with installation:

      ant -f setup-glassfish.xml revert

   8. Run the ant setup script:

      ant -f setup-glassfish.xml

      This starts the GlassFish and database instances, creates all required
      resources in GlassFish, installs the project, and makes it ready for
      future use.
   
   After completing the above procedure, you can skip the remainder of this 
   document.

III. STEPS TO INSTALL FROM SOURCE

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   --- Only perform the steps in this section if you want to install ---
   --- SocialSite software by checking out and compiling the source  ---
   --- code yourself. If you prefer to install SocialSite using the  ---
   --- precompiled JAR-based installer (recommended), skip this      ---
   --- section and instead follow the steps in Section II, above.    ---
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   _______________________________________________________________
   III.A. CHECKING OUT THE WORKSPACE AND COMPILING THE SOURCE CODE

   1. Use your svn client to check out the workspace from java.net:
   
      svn checkout https://socialsite.dev.java.net/svn/socialsite/trunk \ 
      socialsite --username <username>

   2. Change to the socialsite directory.

   3. Use ant to compile the project source code:

      ant dist
   ___________________________________________________
   III.B. DEPLOYING AND INSTALLING THE COMPILED SOURCE

   1. Change to the SocialSite directory:

      cd dist/SocialSite

   2. Edit the glassfish.props file, and specify the following (required):

      a. GLASSFISH_HOME
      b. AS_SERVER_NAME
      c. MAIL_SERVER_NAME
      d. MAIL_USER

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   --- On some Linux systems, it may also be necessary to modify     ---
   --- the DOMAIN_PATH to point to the location of the domain data   ---
   --- directories for your GlassFish installation. For example, on  ---
   --- some Linux systems, the GlassFish binaries are installed in   ---
   --- /usr/share/glassfishv2, but the domain data directories are   ---
   --- installed in /var/lib/glassfishv2. In this case, DOMAIN_PATH  ---
   --- should point to /var/lib/glassfishv2.                         ---
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------

   3. Edit the socialsite.props file and specify the following (optional):

      a. SSADMIN_EMAIL
      b. SSADMIN_USER
      c. SSADMIN_PASSWORD

   4. If you have previously installed SocialSite on this server, you must
      run the following ant task before continuing with installation:

      ant -f setup-glassfish.xml revert

   5. Run the ant setup script:

      ant -f setup-glassfish.xml

      This starts the GlassFish and database instances, creates all required
      resources in GlassFish, installs the project, and makes it ready for
      future use.
